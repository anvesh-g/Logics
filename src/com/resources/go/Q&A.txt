Q) What is the purpose of private constructor?
A) The use of private constructor is to serve singleton classes. A singleton class is one which limits the number of objects creation to one.
   Using private constructor we can ensure that no more than one object can be created at a time. By providing a private constructor you prevent class
   instances from being created in any place other than this very class
Q) How do you create immutable class in Java
A) 1) Declare the class as final so it can’t be extended.
   2) Make all fields private so that direct access is not allowed.
   3) Don’t provide setter methods for variables.
   4) Make all mutable fields final so that its value can be assigned only once.
   5) Initialize all the fields via a constructor performing deep copy
   6) Perform cloning of objects in the getter methods to return a copy rather than returning the actual object
      reference.
Q) What is Deep copy and shallow copy
A) Shallow copy means just referencing to the existing object where as deep copy means creating new object
   referencing to it
Q) In case of overloaded methods eg calculate(String s) and calculate(Object o) if you call Calculate(null) which method will be called
A) calculate(String s)
